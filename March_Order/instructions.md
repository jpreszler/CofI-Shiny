## Instructions

You will need to upload two excel files: Full list and the RSVP list.

The Full list must have columns: "email address", "First Name", "Last Name", and "Decimal Years Since Hire Date" in any order. There also needs to be 1 row before the column headings begin (in the past this has contained a date, but contents are irrelevant).

The RSVP list is the file from the Office 365 form which automatically places "Email" and "Name" columns. The only other column used is "Will you be part of the procession for the 2018 Convocation?". I'm working on making this less specific, perhaps looking for "Will you be" followed by anything, until then it will require minor updates for future events.

If you have problems or requests, please either submit a [gitHub issue](https://github.com/jpreszler/CofI-Shiny) or email Jason Preszler.
