## Instructions
The goal of this activity is to compare your naive idea of "random" sampling with true random sampling. To do this, you will estimate the average (mean) area of "BugTown" appartments by:

* **Method 1** Look at the page of all apartments and estimate the average area. Spend approximately 10-15 seconds surveying the appartments, don't spend time calculating anything.

* **Method 2** Spend approximately 10-15 seconds and select **5** apartment numbers that you believe represent all apartments in BugTown. This is your naive "random" sample, record the apartment numbers for later.

* **Method 3** Use the drop-down menu to have R randomly select **5** apartments for you. The apartment numbers and areas will be listed below the drop-down menu.

Once you've done the 3 methods, go to the *area submission* tab and enter the **apartment numbers** for method 2 and method 3, this will combine your samples with those of your peers so we can compare the two sampling techniques.

You should also use RStudio to compute your mean area estimate using your sample from methods 2 and 3.
