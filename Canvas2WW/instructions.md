## Directions

This app takes an uploaded canvas roster and creates an *lst* file for populating WebWork courses. The downloaded file will have the same name as the uploaded file, but with the *.lst* extension instead of *.csv* (the file contents will differ significantly).

### 1. Exporting Canvas Roster
1. In canvas course, go to Grades
2. Click the **Export** button above gradebook
3. Select **CSV File** to download.

If you already have assignments in your gradebook, they will be ignored by the converter and will not be part of the WebWork roster.

### 2. Upload Canvas CSV
Be sure to wait until "upload complete" is shown

### 3. Click **Download WW**
An *lst* file with the same name as the uploaded *csv* will be downloaded. If you encounter problems, but contact the creator.
